iftop must be run as root.

KNOWN ISSUES

RedHat 7.2:

There is a bug in the version of ncurses distibuted with RedHat 7.2 that
will cause iftop to segfault.  The RPM in RedHat's Rawhide distribution
fixes this.

Slackware 8.1:

You may need to upgrade your libpcap (by updating the tcpdump package) 
in order to compile iftop.

FreeBSD 4.7:

This version of FreeBSD lacks a proper gethostbyaddr_r function. You should
choose an alternative name resolution technique; see comments in the Makefile.
We recommend using ares (-DUSE_ARES).
