.SH NAME
iftop - display bandwidth usage on a network interface by host

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iftop
.B -h
| [
.B -i
.I interface
] [
.B -f
.I filter code
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBiftop\fP listens to network traffic on a named \fIinterface\fP, or \fBeth0\fP
if none is specified, and displays a table of current bandwidth usage by pairs
of hosts.

When run, \fBiftop\fP displays, for each pair of hosts, the rate at which data
is sent and received averaged over 1, 5 and 20 second intervals. The direction
of data flow is indicated by arrows, <= and =>. In addition, a simple bar graph
shows the 5-second average. The pairs of hosts which consume the most bandwidth
are displayed at the top of the screen, and totals for all hosts are shown at
the bottom of the screen.

By default, \fBiftop\fP will look up the hostnames associated with addresses it
finds in packets. This can cause substantial traffic of itself, and may result
in a confusing display. You may wish to suppress display of DNS traffic by
using filter code such as `not port domain', or switch it off entirely, by
using the \fB-d\fP option or the `r' key when the program is running.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Print a summary of usage.

.TP
.B -d
Don't do hostname lookups. This setting may be altered at run time.

.B -p
Run in promiscuous mode, so that traffic which does not pass directly through
the specified interface is also counted.

.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIinterface\fP
Listen to packets on \fIinterface\fP.

.TP
\fB-f\fP \fIfilter code\fP
Use \fIfilter code\fP to select the packets to count. Only IP packets are ever
counted, so the specified code is evaluated as `(\fIfilter code\fP) and ip'.
