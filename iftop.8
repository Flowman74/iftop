.SH NAME
iftop - display bandwidth usage on an interface by host

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBiftop\fP \fB-h\fP |
[\fB-d\fP] [\fB-p\fP] [\fB-i\fP \fIinterface\fP] [\fB-f\fP \fIfilter code\fP] [\fB-n\fP \fInet\fP/\fImask\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBiftop\fP listens to network traffic on a named \fIinterface\fP, or \fBeth0\fP
if none is specified, and displays a table of current bandwidth usage by pairs
of hosts.

When run, \fBiftop\fP displays, for each pair of hosts, the rate at which data
is sent and received averaged over 2, 10 and 40 second intervals. The direction
of data flow is indicated by arrows, <= and =>. In addition, a simple bar graph
shows the 10-second average. The pairs of hosts which consume the most bandwidth
are displayed at the top of the screen, and totals for all hosts are shown at
the bottom of the screen.

By default, \fBiftop\fP will look up the hostnames associated with addresses it
finds in packets. This can cause substantial traffic of itself, and may result
in a confusing display. You may wish to suppress display of DNS traffic by
using filter code such as \fBnot port domain\fP, or switch it off entirely,
by using the \fB-d\fP option or by pressing \fBR\fP when the program is running.

By default, \fBiftop\fP shows all IP packets that pass through the filter, and the direction of the packet is determined according to the direction the packet is moving across the interface.  Using the \fB-n\fP option it is possible to get \fBiftop\fP to show packets entering and leaving a given network.  For example, \fBiftop -n 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0\fP will analyse packets flowing in and out of the 10.* network.

\fBiftop\fP must be run as root.

Some other filter ideas:
.TP
\fBnot ether host ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\fP
Ignore ethernet broadcast packets.
.TP
\fBport http and not host \fP\fIwebcache.example.com\fP
Count web traffic only, unless it is being directed through a local web cache.
.TP
\fBicmp\fP
How much bandwith are users wasting trying to figure out why the network is
slow?


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-h\fP
Print a summary of usage.
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Don't do hostname lookups. This setting may be altered at run time.
.TP
\fB-p\fP
Run in promiscuous mode, so that traffic which does not pass directly through
the specified interface is also counted.
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIinterface\fP
Listen to packets on \fIinterface\fP.
.TP
\fB-f\fP \fIfilter code\fP
Use \fIfilter code\fP to select the packets to count. Only IP packets are ever
counted, so the specified code is evaluated as \fB(\fP\fIfilter code\fP\fB) and ip\fP.
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInet\fP/\fImask\fP
Specifies a network for traffic analysis.  If specified, iftop will only
include packets flowing in to or out of the given network, and packet direction
is determined relative to the network boundary, rather than to the interface.
